The variables are as follows:
\itemize{
\item{\code{df}:}{ \code{data.frame} with the following variables:}
\itemize{
\item{\code{class}:}{ Corresponding class level of ``Ardiac'' curves (with 37 number of classes)}
\item{\code{sample}:}{Factor variable. In UCR, the first 390 values (\code{sample=train}) are used for training sample and the rest of 391 (\code{sample=test}) for testing.}
}
\item{\code{x}:}{ \code{fdata} class object with with n=781 curves (per row) in a sequence length of 176 discretization points (per column).}

\description{
The Automatic Diatom Identification and Classification (ADIAC) project was a pilot study concerning automatic identification of diatoms (unicellular algae) on the basis of images.
A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.
}
\details{
The dataset originally had
37 classes. This built-in data sets one class as the positive class (class 1) and all others
are set to the negative class (class 0) to form a highly imbalanced dataset.
